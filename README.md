# üõ°Ô∏è ThreatLens AI ‚Äì MindFort Technical Take-Home Submission

Welcome to **ThreatLens AI**, an autonomous system designed to visualize and reason over vulnerabilities using a **Vulnerability Knowledge Graph** and **Multi-Agent Chat System**. Built with ‚ö° Next.js, TypeScript, Litellm, and `react-force-graph-2d`, the solution offers both analytical insight and intuitive UX.

 **Live Deployment**:
**Main app**: [https://threatlensai.vercel.app/](https://threatlensai.vercel.app/)
**Knowledge graph**: [https://threatlensai.vercel.app/graph](https://threatlensai.vercel.app/graph)
**Graph API JSON**: [https://threatlensai.vercel.app/api/graph](https://threatlensai.vercel.app/api/graph)
**Chat API endpoint**: [https://threatlensai.vercel.app/api/chat](https://threatlensai.vercel.app/api/chat)

## Project Objective

> Build a full-stack **Vulnerability Knowledge Graph & Multi-Agent Reasoning Chat System** that can ingest security findings, form relational insights between entities, and allow users to query risks or attack paths in natural language.

This project was built according to the requirements outlined in the [MindFort AI Technical Assignment PDF](./MindFort%20AI%20Technical%20Take-Home%20Assignment.pdf).

---

##  Features

### Vulnerability Knowledge Graph (`/graph`)

* Graph visualization of findings using:

  * Nodes for entities: Vulnerability, OWASP, CVE, CWE, Severity, Services, Packages
  * Edges for relationships: Shared libraries, cause-effect links, co-occurrence
* Severity-based node sizing (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
* Color-coded nodes by entity type
* Interactive zoom and labels

---

###  RESTful Graph API (`/api/graph`)

* Returns nodes and edges from ingested findings
* Pre-processed to include:

  * Severity
  * Degree centrality
  * Explicit and inferred relationships

---

### Multi-Agent Reasoning Chat Interface (`/`)

* Users can ask questions like:

  * ‚ÄúAre there any composite risks?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhich services share components?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúCould an attacker chain vulnerabilities?‚Äù
* Behind the scenes:

  * Prompts are routed to agents (via Litellm) simulating multi-perspective reasoning
  * Responses contain explanatory insight, not just answers

## Knowledge Graph Schema

Entities (`nodes`):

* `finding`, `OWASP`, `severity`, `CWE`, `CVE`, `service`, `package`

Relationships (`edges`):

* `finding -> CWE`
* `finding -> service`
* `service -> package`
* `finding -> severity`
* `CWE -> CVE`
* Inferred: shared vulnerable libraries, misconfig lineage

Node sizes vary by severity:

* Critical: largest
* High, Medium, Low: scaled down

## Reasoning Capability

The system identifies **composite risks** automatically. For example:

> ‚Äúspring-web\@5.3.20 is used by both `order-svc` and `auth-svc`. If one service is compromised, it can lead to lateral movement into the other.‚Äù

This type of multi-stage inference is powered by simple graph traversals and LLM-assisted rules in the agent prompt.

---

## Deployment Notes

* Hosted on Vercel (fully SSR-compliant)
* `react-force-graph-2d` is dynamically imported to avoid `window is not defined` errors
* Works across browsers and devices

---

## Environment Variables (sample)

```bash
LITELLM_API_KEY=sk-...
LITELLM_BASE_URL=https://...
```

These are securely stored in Vercel's dashboard and not hardcoded.

---

## Getting Started Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/threatlens-ai.git
cd threatlens-ai
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# add your Litellm credentials

npm run dev
```

Then visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## Improvements & Next Steps

* Add editable graph interface to simulate changes
* Add export as PDF or report
* Extend agent memory for multi-turn reasoning
* Integrate Neo4j if scale increases
* RAG + semantic memory for findings ingestion
